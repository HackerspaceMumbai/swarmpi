I was able to run Docker 1.8 on the RPI by following these steps:

wget http://downloads.hypriot.com/hypriot-rpi-20150727-151455.img.zip 

Unzip the above file:

On an linux system, insert a SD or MMC card

dd if=hypriot-rpi-20150727-151455.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1M

Insert the SD card into RPI and power on. It has docker 1.7 pre-installed. The user is pi with password "raspberry" . Change the default password to something more secure.

You can upgrade to 1.8 by installing http://downloads.hypriot.com/docker-hypriot_1.8.2-1_armhf.deb

Login as superuser and Update the package list  sudo su && apt-get update && apt-get install lynx

Install a sample docker image of Resin for RPI 

docker run -d -p 8081:8081 resin/rpi-google-coder

After it is installed test it as lynx http://localhost:8081. It should connect with the http server.

This will be one of the Swarm nodes

Now I am trying to create a docker-machine on Linux Mint 17 to setup a swarm master

http://downloads.hypriot.com/docker-machine_linux-amd64_0.4.1

Need to create another swarm node to check out the swarm  functionality on RPI
